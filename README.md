# Nextcloud_dockercompose

Simple Docker-compose file with some instructions to deploy on NGINX with SSL provided by certbot & let's encrypt (assuming you've already a let'sencrypt certificate somewhere).
This is based on Ubuntu Server 
(no matter if you have an ARM64 or an AMD64 as images are fetched from official repositories)

It assumes also you have prior knowledge on how to install Docker.
